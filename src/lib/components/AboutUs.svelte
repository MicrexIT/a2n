				Arslane2Narnia is a Rome based charity that supports a wide range of projects and
				initiatives across the globe.
			</span>
			<br />
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}>
				The Foundation was created in 2020 in memory of our dear friend Mohammed Arslane Allaoua.
			</span>
			<br />
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}>
				All of those that have had the chance to meet Arslane know how much he cared for others -
				family, friends, and strangers. [Need to slot in the poem / speak more about Arslo]
			</span>
			<br />
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}>
				He believed beautiful things can happen when people work together towards a common goal.
			</span>
			<br />
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}>
				The Foundation made its first ever grant in March 2022 to a group of Arslane’s friends
				working with the charitable organisation Refugees Welcome to support the people of Ukraine.
				You can learn more about the initiative and the projects we are involved in here.

			<span class={'inline-block'}> “To the people I haven’t met, </span>
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}> I already know that I like you. </span>
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}> Because beauty is not a characteristic trait. </span>
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}> It lies deep inside us, almost as an intrinsic factor, </span>
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}> Almost as the beating of heart. </span>
			<br />
			<br />

			<span class={'inline-block'}> I will love you no matter your origins, </span>
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}> No matter your religion, no matter your temper. </span>
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}>
				I see beauty in the dark where the eyes don’t see but the heart can feel.
			</span>
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}> On the worst day of my life, I will smile to you. </span>
			<br />
			<br />
			<span class={'inline-block'}> Because we are one. </span>
